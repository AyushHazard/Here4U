    <h3>Well Being?</h3>
    <p>Well-being is the experience of health, happiness, and prosperity. It includes having good mental health, high life satisfaction, a sense of meaning or purpose, and ability to
     manage stress. More generally, well-being is just feeling well . Well-being is a positive outcome that is meaningful for people and for many sectors of society, because it tells
      us that people perceive that their lives are going well. Good living conditions (e.g., housing, employment) are fundamental to well-being. Tracking these conditions is important 
      for public policy. However, many indicators that measure living conditions fail to measure what people think and feel about their lives, such as the quality of their relationships,
       their positive emotions and resilience, the realization of their potential, or their overall satisfaction with life—i.e., their “well-being.”1, 2 Well-being generally includes 
       global judgments of life satisfaction and feelings ranging from depression to joy.</p>
    <h3>What is Menatl Health?</h3>
    <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others,
     and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
    Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:<br />
    •	Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry<br />
